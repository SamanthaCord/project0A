**SOS**

<!-- OVERVIEW -->

A fun children's memory game played under pressure! The game is designed to look like a series of red floating buoys in the ocean. The player must navigate across the buoys to safety, following the pattern revealed. To get to the next level they must correctly follow the pattern and beat the shark clock each time. There are 5 levels to complete before the game is won.

It is designed to be played by one person.

<!-- ** HOW TO PLAY ** -->

The player clicks on the SOS button and a 4 dot pattern is revealed (the pattern flashes green for a few seconds before disappearing again). The player must then click on the same 4 dots to get to the next level.

The catch is when the SOS button is clicked it also triggers a 5 second countdown. If the timer runs out before the pattern is completed the game is lost.

The game will not let a player click the SOS button more than one time during each level.
A player can click on an incorrect dot, but if they don't beat the timer they loose the game.
The player can click the dots in any order.
The player can't click on dots once the game is over or won.

The next level will automatically begin each time the previous level is won, but the pattern won't reveal itself until the SOS button is clicked.

To play again once the game is won or lost the player must refresh the browser.

The game uses local storage to keep track of the number of levels passed. If the game is won or lost, the storage resets to zero.

<!-- BUGS -->

a. The player can still click on a dot when the game won titles are visible, sometimes.

<!-- SUGGESTED FUTURE UPDATES  -->

a. A 'safety' buoy graphic could be added outside the game board, and once the final dot is clicked that dot animates out of the board and into the safety buoy to indicate the player has safely crossed.

b. The game could indicate how many levels the player must pass to win and how many levels they have currently passed.

c. The sharks could be animated to look like they are bobbing in the water.

d. The game could only permit the player to enter the pattern in the order it is revealed from the bottom of the board to the top. Currently they can click on the pattern in any order.

e. The game could generate patterns where all dots are in direct proximity to each other to look like they are actually crossing the ocean.

f. The pattern could get longer and increasingly harder at each level.

g. The shark clock could animate a cannon exploding when it gets to zero.
